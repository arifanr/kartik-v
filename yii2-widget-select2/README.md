yii2-widget-select2
===================

This is the Select2 widget and a Yii 2 enhanced wrapper for the [Select2 jQuery plugin](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2). This input widget is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results. The widget is specially styled for Bootstrap 3 and offers a few enhancements not available in the source plugin. The widget allows graceful degradation to a normal HTML select or text input, if the browser does not support JQuery.

> NOTE: This extension is a sub repo split of [yii2-widgets](https://github.com/kartik-v/yii2-widgets). The split has been done since 08-Nov-2014 to allow developers to install this specific widget in isolation if needed. One can also use the extension the previous way with the whole suite of [yii2-widgets](http://demos.krajee.com/widgets).
